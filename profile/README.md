## Hi there :wave:

We're [mint.lgbt](https://mint.lgbt). We build and host services for LGBTQ+ people that provide safe spaces and tools for free.
We've been doing this for a while, and we're planning on continuing that streak for years to come.

### :wrench: Projects we're currently working on

Since we heavily rely on open-source technology, we release almost all of our projects under open-source licenses.

  * [Fedimint](https://github.com/mint-lgbt/fedimint) - Our fork of Akkoma
  * [Polycule](https://github.com/mint-lgbt/polycule) - An open-source Git hosting service inspired by early-2010s GitHub _(currently private until ready)_
  * [mint.lgbt's website](https://github.com/mint-lgbt/website) - The source code to our website
